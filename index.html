        <h3>Dear Sejal</h3>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Tumse pyaar karna mere liye puri zindagi ki sabse aasan cheez thi. I never felt such a connection with anyone else like how I felt with you.
                I never felt so much comfort and peace as much as I do while talking to you and sharing with you. Those cute little gussa waale tone mein tumhari baatein makes
                up the best part of my day and fills me with so much happiness and joy ki saat samundar bhi kam par jaye uske saamne. Your playful taunts
                don't hurt but somehow makes me smile more than usual and their replays ensure foolproofing against any inconveninece.

            <p>
                I admire you more than you would ever realize and adore you more than it is healthy. You mean everything to me. You are my angel as well
                as my devil(jk hai hahaha).you are as beautiful as the night sky, from the inside as well as outside. 
                Everyday, I wake up, I wish it was next to you. Every time I think about you, I realize that I love you more than I did yesterday,
                yet I would feel the same tomorrow too. You are my most precious and most important person and I love you so so much my cutieee raichu. I love you
                and will love you till the end of time, throughout all our future lives and beyond that. You make me so happy like no one else did or can do. I just wanna
                with you forever and ever and wish to spend my whole life with you and get old together. I imagine travelling the whole world with you and sitting
                together on a beautiful beach with our hands together as our souls.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are the best person I have ever met Sejal. You make me giddy like a kid all the time. I want you to know that your presence in my life makes me immeasurably happy and I will keep you
                happy my whole life and would never let you feel sad for a moment. I think even gods must be jealous of me because I have you as my partner and how much you love me.
                You have been with me through some of my toughest time and I know soul to soul how much you love me and care about me. 
                No words can express how much I love you Sejal and how grateful for having you in my life. I just wanna be with my love forever. 
            </p>

                LOVE YOU SEJAL FOREVER ><
